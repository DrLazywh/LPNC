# Learnable Prompts with Neighbor-aware Correction for Text-based Person Search

---

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights
- We propose a Learnable Prompts with Neighbor-aware Correction framework that employs dynamic prompt integration and neighbor-aware retrieval correction to enhance text-based person search.
- We design a Learnable Prompt-guided Semantic Alignment module that integrates textual and visual representations into pseudo-tokens, ensuring semantic consistency and bridging the modality gap through a prompt-guided cross-attention mechanism.
- We introduce the \textit k-nearest Neighbor Correction strategy which adaptively re-adjusts retrieval scores based on the \textit k-nearest neighbor query to enhance retrieval performance without extra training.
