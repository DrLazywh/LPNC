# Learnable Prompts with Neighbor-aware Correction for Text-based Person Search

---

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights
- We propose a Learnable Prompts with Neighbor-aware Correction framework that employs dynamic prompt integration and neighbor-aware retrieval correction to enhance text-based person search.
- We design a Learnable Prompt-guided Semantic Alignment module that integrates textual and visual representations into pseudo-tokens, ensuring semantic consistency and bridging the modality gap through a prompt-guided cross-attention mechanism.
- We introduce the \textit k-nearest Neighbor Correction strategy which adaptively re-adjusts retrieval scores based on the \textit k-nearest neighbor query to enhance retrieval performance without extra training.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### 1. Requirements
```bash
pytorch >= 1.9.0
torchvision >= 0.10.0
prettytable
easydict
```


### 2. Prepare Datasets

Download the CUHK-PEDES dataset from [here](https://github.com/ShuangLI59/Person-Search-with-Natural-Language-Description),  
ICFG-PEDES dataset from [here](https://github.com/ShuangLI59/Person-Search-with-Natural-Language-Description),  
and RSTPReid dataset from [here](https://github.com/NjtechCVLab/RSTPReid-Dataset).

Organize them in your `dataset root dir` folder as follows:
```bash
|-- your dataset root dir/
| |-- <CUHK-PEDES>/
| |-- imgs
| |-- cam_a
| |-- cam_b
| |-- ...
| |-- reid_raw.json
|
| |-- <ICFG-PEDES>/
| |-- imgs
| |-- test
| |-- train
| |-- ICFG_PEDES.json
|
| |-- <RSTPReid>/
| |-- imgs
| |-- data_captions.json
```
